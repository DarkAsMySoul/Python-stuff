This is where I'll put any pieces of code I've put together that's worth looking. I'll also
provide short summaries to each file.

A simple battle arena game inspired by classic rpg's in a text-based format.

I couldn't say that it was finished, and I want to add more to it in future.

Known bugs:
Strong possibility of encountering a recursion error after encounter 90. I think
I know why this is happening, but I don't know when I'll fix it.
